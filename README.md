# ModFw

A framework for developing and modifying devices. This includes not only the
firmware but the devices in which the firmware runs as well as devices the
firmware controls.

ModFw also supports developing and modifying a means of deploying, monitoring,
and controlling these devices remotely in keeping with the Internet of Things
concept.

Secure remote access is provided using proxys running on platforms provided
by hosting companies such as Hostwinds, Godaddy, and Midphase to name just a
few. ModFw provides mechanisms for managing the keys needed as well as
establishing tunnels for communicating with individual devices.
