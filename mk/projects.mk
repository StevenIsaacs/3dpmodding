Make segment: ${prjSeg}.mk

This segment uses git manage project specific configurations. If the git
repo doesn't exist then it must first be created using the create-project
goal. The project is either created or cloned depending upon the value of
PROJECTS_REPO (below). These configurations define the options for
kits and mods within the kits.

Each project has a subdirectory in the repository. The variable PROJECT
specifies which project is active. If a project directory does not exist it
must be created using the create-project goal (below).

A project makefile segment is generated and stored in the project
subdirectory when the project is created. The developer modifies this
file as needed. This is typically used to override kit and mod variables
but project specific variables, goals and recipes can be added. The developer
is also expected to add them to the repo and commit changes as needed.

Sticky variables are stored in the project subdirectory thus allowing each
project to have unique values for sticky variables. This segment change
STICKY_PATH to point to the project specific sticky variables which are also
maintained in the repo.

A new project can be based upon an existing project by specifying the
existing project using the SEED_PROJECT command line option. In this case
the existing project files are copied to the new project. The project
specific segment is renamed for the new project and all project references
in the new project are changed to reference the new project. For reference
the seed project config file is copied to the new project.

Required sticky command line variables:
  PROJECT = ${PROJECT}
    The name of the project. This is used to create or switch to the
    project specific directory in the project configurations repo. This
    variable is stored in the default sticky directory.
    DEFAULT_STICKY_PATH = ${DEFAULT_STICKY_PATH}

Optional sticky variables:
  PROJECTS_PATH = ${PROJECTS_PATH}
  Default: DEFAULT_PROJECTS_PATH = ${DEFAULT_PROJECTS_PATH}
  Where the project specific configurations are stored. This is the location
  of a git repo.
  PROJECTS_REPO = ${PROJECTS_REPO}
  Default: DEFAULT_PROJECTS_REPO = ${DEFAULT_PROJECTS_REPO}
    If this is equal to local then a git repo is created to manage the
    configurations. Otherwise a git repo is cloned to install existing project
    specific kit and mod configurations.
  PROJECTS_BRANCH = ${PROJECTS_BRANCH}
  default: DEFAULT_PROJECTS_BRANCH = ${DEFAULT_PROJECTS_BRANCH}
    This is the branch used by the projects. The repo is
    switched to this branch before creating the new branch.

Changes:
  STICKY_PATH = ${STICKY_PATH}
  Changed to point to the project directory in the projects repo.

Command line options:
  SEED_PROJECT = ${SEED_PROJECT}
  When defined and creating a new project using create-project the new
  project is initialized by copying files from the seed project to the new
  project. e.g. make SEED_PROJECT=<existing> create-project

Command line goals:
  help-${prjSeg}
    Display this help.
  show-projects
    Display a list of projects in the project repo.
  create-project
    Create a new project in the projects repo. If the repo does not exist
    it is either cloned from a remote repo or a new local repo is created
    depending upon the PROJECTS_REPO variable.
